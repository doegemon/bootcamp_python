# Python Studies Repository
This repository contains my Python studies focused on data engineering. 

I started by revisiting some very basic concepts (data types, conditions with if and else, loops with for and while), moving on to how to create ETL pipelines and the importance of POO, and finishing with APIs and a CRUD application. 

After seeing all this, it's time to put what I've studied into practice by creating projects to solve problems that companies and people face on a daily basis. 

This bootcamp is part of the content available at [Jornada de Dados](https://suajornadadedados.com.br/).
